## Analyzing a Spotify dataset using Pandas in Python
<br>
For this project, I will analyze a Spotify dataset. The Spotify dataset (which can be found in my Github repository for this project) carries various information on artists’ songs from 1920-2021. The whole file has multiple datasets, but I have chosen three datasets to analyze — “data_by_year”, “data_by_genre”, and “data_by_artist”. So how exactly have songs changed over the years? What's the most popular genre on Spotify? Let’s find this out and more.
