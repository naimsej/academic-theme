I am a senior at Georgia Tech University majoring in Economics. My coursework includes areas in mathematics, statistics, economics, and computer science. On top of my coursework, I am always looking for new opportunities to learn more about methods and technologies used in data science.

Outside of class, I enjoy writing music, playing the guitar, and playing tennis. I am always excited to talk to anyone interested about my projects or my hobbies so donâ€™t hesitate to contact me here or on LinkedIn!
